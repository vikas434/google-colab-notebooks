# README: Google Colab Enterprise File Upload and Vertex AI Call

This Jupyter Notebook outlines a process for uploading a file via Google Colab, processing the file content with Vertex AI, and saving the result to Google BigQuery.

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates the integration of various Google Cloud services including Colab, Vertex AI, and BigQuery. The primary goal is to expand acronyms using a pre-trained model from Vertex AI and store the results in BigQuery.

## Steps Overview

1. **Install Dependencies**: Setting up the necessary Python packages.
2. **Authenticate with Google Colab**: Ensuring access to Google Cloud resources.
3. **Define and Create BigQuery Table Schema**: Preparing the database for storing results.
4. **Initialize Vertex AI**: Configuring Vertex AI services.
5. **Load Pre-trained Model**: Importing a pre-trained model from Vertex AI.
6. **Acronym Expander Function**: Developing a function to expand acronyms.
7. **File Upload**: Uploading the file to be processed.
8. **Process File Content**: Applying the acronym expander on the file content.
9. **Save Results to BigQuery**: Storing the expanded acronyms in a BigQuery table.

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

We use `pandas-gbq` to facilitate interactions with BigQuery.

```bash
!pip install pandas-gbq
```

## Step 2: Authenticate with Google Colab
Google Colab authentication is required to access Google Cloud resources.

```python
from google.colab import auth as google_auth
google_auth.authenticate_user()
```

## Step 3: Define and Create BigQuery Table Schema
The BigQuery client is initialized, and a table schema is defined and created.

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
# [Code for initializing client and creating table]
```

## Step 4: Initialize Vertex AI
Initialization of Vertex AI with project details.

```python
import vertexai
# [Code for initializing Vertex AI]
```

## Step 5: Load the Pre-trained Model
Loading the model from Vertex AI.


```python
# [Code for loading model]
```

## Step 6: Define Acronym Expander Function
This function takes a column name and returns its expanded form using the model.

```python
# [Code for defining acronym expander function]
```

## Step 7: Upload the File
Facilitates the uploading of a CSV file for processing.

```python
from google.colab import files
# [Code for uploading file]
```

## Step 8: Process File Content
Processes the uploaded file to expand acronyms.

```python
import pandas as pd
import os
# [Code for processing file content]
```

## Step 9: Save Results to BigQuery
The expanded acronyms are stored in a specified BigQuery table.

```python

# [Code for saving results to BigQuery]
```


## Conclusion
This notebook provides an automated approach to expanding acronyms using a pre-trained model from Vertex AI and storing the results in BigQuery for further analysis.

Ensure that all necessary permissions and credentials are set up in your Google Cloud project.
Replace <<project_id>>, <<table_id>>, and <<gbq_table_result>> with your actual project and table IDs.
